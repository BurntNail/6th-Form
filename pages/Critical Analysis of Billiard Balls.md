- History of Materials:
	- The earliest Billiard Balls were created using wood and clay (although clay remained in use until even the 20th century).
	- The original affordable balls were made of Ox bones, and although they were in common use in Europe, Elephant Ivory was favoured until the early 20th century.
	- Eventually, John Wesley Hyatt created Nitrocellulose, an early plastic. More soon followed.
	- Now, we have lots more modern materials, which are strongly resistant to cracking and chipping.
- From Ivory
	- The earliest known reference to Ivory Billiard Balls is in the 1588 inventory of the Duke of Norfolk.
		- Dyed and numbered versions first appeared around the early 1770s.
	- Unfortunately, no more than 8 billiard balls can be made per one elephant's tusks. This means that at least two elephants would have needed to die per set, leading to a large poaching problem with elephants becoming endangered.
	- There were Ivory substitutes like the earlier mentioned Ox bone, Clay and Wood balls, as well as faux Ivory materials like Sorel Cement, but these weren't as popular.
- Plastics
	- However, a New York supplier asked for an alternative for a $10,000 prize, now worth over $200,000.
	- Eventually, in 1869 John Wesley Hyatt invented a material called nitrocellulose, branded Celluloid in 1870, one of the very first plastics.
	- Soon after, other materials were developed to increase the longevity of the plastic, like Bakelite and Acrylic.
	- Nowadays, lots of plastics and resins are used, like [Saluc](https://www.saluc.com/index.html) who manufacture the famous [Aramith Billiard Balls](https://www.aramith.com/) which use Phenolic Resin.
- Sustainability
	- Although plastic is now used, this is a far cry more sustainable than the Ivory balls of old which decimated elephant populations.

	- So far as I can tell, modern Billiard Balls cannot be easily recycled. However, people often see Billiard Balls as a low-order good, meaning that they are not bought very often, and they are used for a very long time.
	- This is a much better use for our limited oil supplies than single-use plastic water bottles which can be used multiple times, but are often discarded after a single use. Many people also forget to even send them to recycling. Then, even if items are sent to recycling, they are often exported (as shown by [[The BBC]] ) to other countries (often very far away in South-East Asia) which creates a larger environmental impact. [[The Times]] has also shown that plastic sent for recycling is often burnt for fuel.
	- Wood and clay balls were also often used, but were used much less commonly than ivory balls due to inferior quality. I believe that our modern balls represent a good middle ground between ivory and wood/clay - better for the environment, and still a good quality of ball.
- To conclude, over their lifetimes, Billiard Balls have become more constant (good for competitions), easier to get a hold of and they're better now for the environment than they used to be.
