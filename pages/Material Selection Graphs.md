	- ### Many aluminium alloys are heat treatable – what does this mean and how is strength affected
		- This means that they can change strength and hardness using heat. This means that these materials can be in multiple places on the Material Selection Graph. **increase wear resistance, mention anneal**
	- ### Select Materials for a Rucksack
		- Use Carbon Fibre, as it is both quite strong and not too dense (not dissimilar from water). It can also be interwoven into other materials.
		- You could also use Nylon, as it is less strong than Carbon Fibre, but much lighter.
		- **Also polyester, cheap, lightweight, floats**
	- ### Select materials for a car wheel
		- You could use a material like Titanium as it is quite strong, as well as dense to make sure the car is firmly on the ground.
		- You could also use another metal like Stainless Steel, which is cheaper.

	- ### Which polymers float?
		- PMAA
		- uPVC
		- UF
		- Polystyrene
		- Polycarbonate
		- Nylon
		- **Mention < dense than water at:** $1000kg/m^3$
	- ### Why do brass and copper have similar properties?
		- Both contain Copper, just Brass is an alloy.
	- ### Why are designers trying to use composites in aircraft?
		- Because you can combine multiple materials with different properties to get the best properties of other materials. **Lighter, strength for less weight**
