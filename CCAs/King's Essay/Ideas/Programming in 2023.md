#CCAs/KE 

Use rust to create a new programming language.
 - Maybe focused on speed - minimal set of instructions
 - Use it to speak about different approaches and types of programming languages (functional vs declarative)
 - Maybe host it on a VPS and use that to show how programming languages work from a management POV
 - Maybe pivot into speaking about Docker and infrastructure as code
 - Obviously, write it in (La/Xe)TeX
