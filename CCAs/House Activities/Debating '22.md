## Speaking Stuff
## Legislation
speak about how legislation is always necessary, and already exists that protects consumers from our definition:
>The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations mean you cannot mislead or harass consumers by, for example:
> -   including false or deceptive messages
> -   leaving out important information
> -   using aggressive sales techniques

maybe make some suggestions to make the law fit the definition, or maybe some stuff about choosing which photos to use.

## Common Sense
People also have to have critical thinking skills...
