The graph of \(f(x)\), here as an example: \(y = x^2\).
\plotbasic{x^2}


\parttitle{Translation}
\textbf{The graph of \(f(x-a)\) is the graph of \(f(x)\) translated right by \(a\) units.} For example, if we want to move our graph 2 units right, then we can plot \(y = (x-2)^2\).
\plotbasic{(x-2)^2}

\textbf{The graph of \(f(x)+b\) is the graph of \(f(x)\) translated upwards by \(b\) units.} For example, if we want to move our graph 3 units down, then we can plot \(y = x^2 - 3\).
\plotbasic{x^2-3}


\parttitle{Scaling}
\nb{Never say shrink - always say stretch by a factor \(e\) where \(|e| < 1\)}

\textbf{The graph of \(cf(x)\) is the graph of \(f(x)\) stretched vertically by a factor of \(c\).} For example, if we want to stretch our graph by a factor of 2, then we can plot \(y = 2 * x^2\).
\plotbasic{2 * x^2}

\textbf{The graph of \(f(dx)\) is the graph of \(f(x)\) stretched horizontally by a factor of \(d^{-1}\).} For example, if we want to stretch our graph by a factor of 5, then we can plot \(y = (0.2 * x)^2\).
\plotbasic{(0.2*x)^2}

\begin{example}{\arabic{TransformationsCounter}}{Combining Transformations}
	
	\[
		y = cf(\frac{1}{a} * (x-b)) + d
	\]
	
	This is obtained from \(f(x)\) by doing the following:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Shift from the right \(b\) units.
		\item Stretch horizontally by a factor of \(a\).
		\item Stretch vertically by a factor of \(c\).
		\item Shift upwards by \(d\) units.
	\end{enumerate}
	
\end{example}
\addtocounter{TransformationsCounter}{1}
\begin{example}{\arabic{TransformationsCounter}}{Combining Transformations}
	
	\[
	y = f(-2x)
	\]
	
	This is obtained from \(f(x)\) by doing the following:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Flip horizontally.
		\item Stretch horizontally by a factor of \(0.5\).
	\end{enumerate}
	
\end{example}
