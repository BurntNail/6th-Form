A battery contains chemicals which create a potential difference between the 2 ends of the battery. Therefore, when we connect the 2 ends, we get a flow of [[Electric Current]]. Conventional Current flows from Positive to negative.

For example, an electron might pick up energy and start at the negative pole. It'll then go around the circuit, and when it reaches eg. a lamp, it will deposit the energy there, but will keep on moving. Then, when it goes back to the start, it gets more energy and on and on.
Either that, or think of the hill.

Therefore, we have an emf ($\epsilon$ / Volt) across the cell.

We can use a voltmeter to measure the potential difference. It must have a very high resistance, and be in parallel.
