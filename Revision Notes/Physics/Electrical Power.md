$$P=\frac{W}{t} \quad \quad W=VQ \quad \therefore \quad P=\frac{VQ}{t} \quad I=\frac{Q}{t} \quad \therefore \quad P=IV$$

That is a greater potential difference or a greater current leads to a greater amount of electrical energy dissipated over a component, every second therefore more electrical power.

$$P = IV \quad V=IR \quad \therefore \quad P=I^2R=\frac{V^2}{R}$$
