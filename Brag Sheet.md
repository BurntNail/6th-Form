# Jack Maguire's Github Projects

This is all of my projects as a quick reference. Each project should include something I've learnt, why I did it and how it ended.

## Precipice
Spring-Summer 2023, a basic project for measuring how long something takes. The first time I ever used async in a project, and had thorough documentation. I did it initially to measure a King's Essay project to compare execution times in different languages and then I kept on adding features. You can now produce histograms, CSV files and get instant feedback on std dev/mean/min/max/median. Now feature complete and I'm pretty happy to leave it where it is. Rust.

## KE
Spring 2023, the same few projects in a bunch of different languages. An interesting exercise in translation and seeing changing idioms and customs. I did it initially for the King's Essay before the benchmarker reached 1k LOC. Once I had enough to speak about, I stopped as I didn't need to carry on for any longer. Rust/C/C++/C#/Python/Go/Java/Zig

## LaTeX Cleaner
Summer 2023, i've learnt LaTeX over the last few years to typeset maths, and I now do about a third of my maths homework using it. This aims to clean up all of the junk files that get created, and to recompile the existing sources. This was strictly a utility project, so I didn't learn much, and it finished when it started working - any time extra spent on it was wasted as I wasn't doing Maths homework. Rust.

## Wave Function Collapse
Spring 2023, this was an interesting experiment in terrain generation inspired by a youtube video I watched - no code, only the concept. I learnt some basic optimisation, and by now I don't think I can reasonably call it WFC as it doesn't truly follow it to ensure that it works fast enough. I finished it when I decided I'd proved enough and could use it in the future if I needed to. Rust.

## Drawing Squares
Summer 2021, My first proper rust library (or crate, as in the local lingo), designed for cellular automata to speed up window creation. I learnt how to create a library and publish it and as of 22/4/2023 it has over 150 downloads. I finished it when I moved on to create a basic Conway's Game of Life program using it. Rust.

## Obsidian Scripts
Summer 2022. I've used Obsidian MD for notes for a few years now, and I rigorously categorise all of my notes to be able to sort through them using a plugin called `Dataview` and the javascript library it provides. This has been my only major exploration into Javascript and that is what I learnt. Javascript.

## Advent of Code
Winter 2022. I participated in Advent of Code 2022 for the first 15 days until I got really confused because graph theory hasn't stuck for me yet as a programmer. I ended up learning a lot about parsing weird text formats into in-memory representations without using JSON or other serialisation/deserialisation helpers. Rust.

## Distribution Calculator
Winter 2022 - Summer 2023. Whilst completing past ACT papers, I wanted to see the proportions of each answer I'd entered, so I created a program which took either a file or stdin and printed the contents and their percentages of the whole. It can also be used to check for commonly used words in things like essays. I didn't learn much as it was strictly a utility project, and I finished it when it printed everything correctly. Rust.

## Fizz Buzz
Winter 2020 - my first proper rust project, which was a very basic fizzbuzz that had support for an unlimited number of conditions and I did it after learning rust. I also later used it to create an Arch Linux AUR PKGBUILD file, which I used to publish it to the AUR. Rust/PKGBUILD.

## Fractal Maker
Winter 2022 - a quick and simple program to look at an embarrasingly parallel problem. I later used the mandlebrot algorithm for the KE projects. Rust.

## Async Chess
Summer 2022 - a Client/Server Multiplayer game of chess designed to be able to be played without both players online at once. I learnt a lot about network requests, synchronisation, multiplayer, and the necessity of multiple threads when combining UI and Networking. I had some really cool features in there like moving the piece on the local board before sending the network request to make it more responsive even when in high-ping environments. Rust/Go.

## Janki
Summer-Winter 2022 - a spaced repetition program, similar to Anki. I learnt lots about persistent storage and github actions. I finished it when I lost motivation due to the difficulty of web-like framworks and confusing DSLs. Rust.

## English Quotes
Spring-Summer 2022 - a program for storing and categorising quotes. Each quote can have multiple categories, you can sort in different ways. I learnt more about JSON, TUI interfaces and I got comfortable with an immediate mode GUI library which I've used in many projects since. Rust.

## Lonely Tribes
Summer 2021 - Spring 2022 - a game similar to 2048, coded without a game engine entirely in Rust. I learnt about a wide variety of different areas from API integrations and FFI, to serialisation of level data and cloud saves, to marketing and organisation of huge projects. It originally launched paid, and is now free to download on Steam as I didn't think I would ever make it to the payout threshold. Around 6k LOC Rust.

## Apex Turrets
Winter 2019 - Spring 2020 - a tower defence game I created for the Non-Examined Assesment portion of my Coursework. It's been a while since I worked on it, but I managed to dive deep with Java (around 5-6k LOC), learning about configuration files for games, drawing sprites, sound design. Java.
