- # What actually drains electrons round the circuit?
	- When a complete conductive loop is made from positive to negative there is an electric field that passes through the wire. This has the effect of producing a force on charge carriers, moving the delocalised electrons in metals. All electrons move together immediately.

			- $-1.6*10^{-19}C$
	- For example, when *charging* the Van de Graff generator for 10s, it gained a charge of $304 nC$. We can divide the charge by the magnitude of one electron to get the number of electrons that were transferred to the Van de Graff generator: $1.9*10^{12}$.
