- Environmental Considerations
	- Where are the materials from?
	- Pollution levels in production and transportation.
	- Limiting finite resources in the selection of materials.
	- The 6 Rs:
		- Rethink
		- Reduce
		- Reuse
		- Repair
		- Recycle
		- Refuse
- Cost & Availability
	- Transportation - Where are the raw materials located? Where are the materials produced? Are pre-prepared parts made in off shore? What sort of transportation is required? etc.
	- Processing of materials & components
	- Considering pre-prepared component parts
	- Material finishing or pre-coated rather than in house can change the final costing
	- Specialist machinery required for material choices & off shore cheap manufacturing
	- Standard sizes and parts
	- Ensuring parts meet appropriate standards
	- Supply & Demand

- Function & Aesthetics
	- Functional Performance
		- Refers to how it actually works and performs, eg. weight, durability, elasticity.
		- Every product will have a crucial criteria, usually established during the development stage, that the material selection will usually depend on.
		- For example, a product must support a specific load.
	- Aesthetics
		- Within its widest interpretation, aesthetics is involved with our senses. The emotional response it evokes through the vision, feel, etc.
	- Form vs Function
		- Which takes priority follows industry norms (eg. fashion vs cars).
