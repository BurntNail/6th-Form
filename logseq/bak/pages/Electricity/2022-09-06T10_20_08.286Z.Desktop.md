	- Easy
		- 1
			- The flow of electrons  **rate of flow of charge - close but not quite, also:** $I=\frac{Q}{t}$
		- 2
			- $V = IR$
		- 3
			- $P = IV = 5 * 2 = 10W$
		- 4
			- ![Filament Lamp Resistance.png](../assets/Filament_Lamp_Resistance_1662392724615_0.png)
		- 5
			- ![LED Circuit Symbol.png](../assets/LED_Circuit_Symbol_1662392741415_0.png)
		- 6
	- Getting Harder
		- 1
			- The number of joules per coulomb **or energy transferred over number =>** $V = \frac{E}{Q}$
		- 2
			- Coulomb
		- 3
			- ?? **In a closed circuit, resistance is directly proportional to current**
		- 4
			- ![Metal Wire Resistance Graphs.png](../assets/Metal_Wire_Resistance_Graphs_1662392789093_0.png)
		- 5
			- $V_1 = 6V, V_2 = 6V$
	- A bit difficult?
		- 1
			- $R_{total} = 5 + 1 = 6Ω$
			  $V_1 = 12 * \frac{1}{6} = 2V$
			  $V_2 = 12 * \frac{5}{6} = 10V$
		- 2
			- $V = IR, I = V/R$
			  $I_1 = 6 / 2 = 3A$
			  $I_2 = 6/3 = 2A$
		- 3
			- No change as measuring from fixed resistor.
			  **no - resistance in whole circuit changes, so gets lower, because LDR gets more voltage so Fixed Resistor gets less voltage**
		- 4
			- ![Graphed Circuit.png](../assets/Graphed_Circuit_1662392933042_0.png)
	- Extension
		- 1
			- a
				- $3V$
			- b
				- $R_{total} = 1 + 1 = 2 Ω$
				  $V = 3 * \frac{1}{2} = 1.5V$
			- c
				- $1 / R_{total} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \ldots$
				  $1/x = 1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6$
				  $x = 6/5 = 1.2Ω$
- Current & Drift Velocity
	- $I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}, V = \frac{E}{Q}, V=IR$
	- # What actually drains electrons round the circuit?
		- When a complete conductive loop is made from positive to negative there is an electric field that passes through the wire. This has the effect of producing a force on charge carriers, moving the delocalised electrons in metals. All electrons move together immediately.
		- ![Electrons relating to A, C and I.png](../assets/Electrons_relating_to_A,_C_and_I_1662393047839_0.png)
		- ![Electrons passing through an electric field.png](../assets/Electrons_passing_through_an_electric_field_1662393058140_0.png)
		- Electrons are our charge carriers in electric circuits. They have a charge of $-1.6*10^{-19}C$. For example, when *charging* the Van de Graff generator for 10s, it gained a charge of $304 nC$. We can divide the charge by the magnitude of one electron, and then divide that by the time taken to get the number of electrons that were transferred to the Van de Graff generator: $1.9*10^{12}$.
- Charge & Current Hw
	- Charge
		- Measured in Coulombs. ?
	- Charge Density
		- ?
	- Current
		- The flow of negative electrons through a conductor. It is measured in Amps.
	- Voltage / Potential Difference
		- Voltage is a measure of the difference in electrical energy between two parts of a circuit. It is measured in Volts.
	- Electromotive Force
		- The amount of energy delivered per unit electric charge from a battery. It is measured in Volts.
	- Power
		- Also known as Radiant Flux. It is used for the rate of energy transfer. It is measured in Watts.
	- Electron
		- A subatomic particle with one elementary negative charge.
	- Volt
		- One volt is defined as the electrical potential between two points of a conducting wire when an electric current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power between those points.
	- Coulomb
		- It is defined as the amount of charge delivered by one amp of current in one second.
	- Ampere
		- Originally, it was defined as the current that would need to pass through 2 parallel wires 1 metre apart to produce a magnetic force of $2*10^{-7}$ N/m. Now it has been defined with decimal precision.
	- Watt
		- It is defined as the power from 1 Joule per second.
	- Joule
		- It is defined as the work done when a force of 1N displaces a mass through a distance of 1m in the direction of the force applied.
