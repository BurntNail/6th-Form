- Charge
	- Measured in Coulombs. ?
- Charge Density
	- ?
- Current
	- The flow of negative electrons through a conductor. It is measured in Amps.
- Voltage / Potential Difference
	- Voltage is a measure of the difference in electrical energy between two parts of a circuit. It is measured in Volts.
- Electromotive Force
	- The amount of energy delivered per unit electric charge from a battery. It is measured in Volts.
- Power
	- Also known as Radiant Flux. It is used for the rate of energy transfer. It is measured in Watts.
- Electron
	- A subatomic particle with one elementary negative charge.
- Volt
	- One volt is defined as the electrical potential between two points of a conducting wire when an electric current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power between those points.
- Coulomb
	- It is defined as the amount of charge delivered by one amp of current in one second.
- Ampere
	- Originally, it was defined as the current that would need to pass through 2 parallel wires 1 metre apart to produce a magnetic force of $2*10^{-7}$ N/m. Now it has been defined with decimal precision.
- Watt
	- It is defined as the power from 1 Joule per second.
- Joule
	- It is defined as the work done when a force of 1N displaces a mass through a distance of 1m in the direction of the force applied.
