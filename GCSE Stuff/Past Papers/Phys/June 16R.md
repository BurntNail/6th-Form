#### b
As the particles move around randomly, eventually they will hit one of the walls of the container, imparting a force on it. Many particles doing this very often creates a pressure.

#### c
The pressure would increase.

#### d
mass stays constant
move faster
average distance decreases

#### b
Gravitational Potential Energy -> Thermal Energy, as the rock gets heated.
Rock Thermal Energy -> Water/Steam Thermal Energy, as the rock heats up the water and boils it
Thermal Energy -> Kinetic Energy, as the steam passes through the turbine and condenses in the condenser
Kinetic Energy -> Electrical Energy, in the generator.
Electrical Energy -> Kinetic Energy, in the pump.

p = hρg
###### ii
![[June 16R 6.a.ii.png|500]] **actually wrong - lower ones have more pressure so go further out - see below**
![[June 16R 6.a.ii_C.png|500]]
###### iii
They have less height on top of them, so the pressure difference is lower, so they exert less force, so the water comes out slower. **see above for exp on why wrong**

#### b
###### i
![[June 16R 6.b.i.png|500]]
#### ii
When the water is poured in, the height increases and exerts a pressure. This pressure can be equalised when the water reaches the same level in all of the sections, regardless of radius or shape. **kinda right, but bad**
> 1) **two vessels are connected**
> 2) **same density**
> 3) **air pressure same for all**
> 4) **pressure only depends on depth, not shape**

###### iii
Because the light enters a more optically dense medium, it bends towards the normal. **no - it wants a change in speed**

It carries so little current that it can be safely grounded through a person touching it?

Alpha particles are helium nuclei, beta particles are electrons.
Alpha particles can't penetrate more than a few cm of air, beta particles can't penetrate more than skin.
Alpha particles are much more ionising than beta particles.
###### iii
Tritium doesn't have enough protons (needs 2, has 1).

#### b
The glass tubes block the beta particles, so they cannot reach any people. **need a better exp**

HL = 13yrs

#### d
1200 -> 400 = 1.5 half lives
1.5 \* 13 = 19.5 years.
The manufacturer is almost right.

## 10
Radiation from black inside of the oven transfers heat by EM waves.
Convection from heating element causes hot air to rise and cook the potatoes by conduction.
Conduction from the hot air and metal spikes transfers heat by transferring the kinetic energy via vibrations.

**speed inc -> drag starts to act -> downward force increases -> acceleration decreases**

#### d
The mass will decrease, so the acceleration will increase.

**make results more reliable, ID anomalies, may have been temp change, may have been friction**

#### b
###### i
Because there are no values that come close to either x-axis or y-axis, **so reduced scale gives fuller use of grid - that was fine, but it could be better**
###### ii
Curve of best fit - as the student continues to increase the volume, the pressure will decrease at a slower rate, which will be better demonstrated by a curve.
###### iii
Use the same temperature of gas each time.
###### iv
Repeat the experiment, and average the results.
Use some different gases or temperatures.

#### c
Her conclusion is correct, as PV=T, and for every row on her table, the temperature stays around the same value (5, using P in Pa and V in m<sup>3</sup>). For example, for the first row, 100,000Pa multiplied by 5\*10<sup>-5</sup> is 5, and in a later row, 84,000Pa multiplied by 6\*10<sup>-5</sup> is 5.04 - very close to 5 (within 0.8%).
