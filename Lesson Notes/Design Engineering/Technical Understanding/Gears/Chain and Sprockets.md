Similar to [[Pulleys & Belts]], but gears and teeth. eg. bicycles.

## Pros
 - Only 2 gear wheels and a chain needed to transmit rotary motion of a distance.
 - No slip and creep.
 - Same direction.
 - Can go under adverse conditions.
 - Transmits more power than [[Pulleys & Belts]] but less than Gear drives.

## Cons
 - Higher production cost.
 - Needs careful maintenance, lubrication, and slack adjustment.
 - If not enough lubrication, chain wears out faster than [[Pulleys & Belts]].
 - Generally heavier.
