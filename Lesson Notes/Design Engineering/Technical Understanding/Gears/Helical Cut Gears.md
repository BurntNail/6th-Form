# Overview
Have their teeth cut at an angle across the gearwheel. Each tooth is slightly curved so that it forms part of a spiral/helix.
Quieter and more efficient than [[Spur Gears]]. This is because the teeth engage more gradually, they have a smoother/quieter operation than spur gears. This also means that they last longer.
Most car gearboxes use these, apart from Reverse which has [[Spur Gears|Straight Cut Gears]], which is why reverse is often noisy.

# Cons
 - There is axial thrust which results along the gear axis, which needs to be accommodated by using adequate thrust bearings.
 - Higher manufacture cost.
