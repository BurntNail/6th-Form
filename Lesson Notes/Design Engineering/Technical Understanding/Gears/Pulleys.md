A pulley system with the effort applied from above is very difficult to use. The most comfortable way to use a single moving pulley is to combine it with a fixed pulley, seen below. This allows the effort to be applied downwards.

## Example
![[pulley-system.gif|400]]
$$MA = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \quad \quad VR = \frac{4}{1} = 4$$
$$Effort = \frac{100N}{4} = 25N \quad \quad Distance = \frac{4m}{4} =1m$$
