 - When 2 [[Spur Gears]] mesh they can be treated as though they were 2 wheels, each with a diameter known as the Pitch Circle Diameter (PCD).
 - The PCD can be used to determine the separation of drive shafts.
 - For gears to mesh correctly, they must have the same tooth pitch (number of teeth per millimetre around the circumference). This is determined by the module.

$$Module(mm) = \frac{PCD(mm)}{Number\ Teeth}$$
