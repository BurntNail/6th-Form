![[worm_gear.gif|500]]

 - The worm only has 1 tooth but it is like a screw thread.
 - The worm always drives the worm wheel around, it is never the opposite way around as the system tends to lock & jam.
 - They allow the direction of motion to be changed, so that a motor can sit perpendicular to the spur gear on an axle.

 - For gear calculations, worm gears always count as one tooth.
