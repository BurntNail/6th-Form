 - Mostly rely on friction to operate effectively
 - Input and output shafts rotate on the same direction.
 - Belt typically made of rubber. Can also be made of rope, cord, steel cable (eg. ski lift)

## Pros
 - Simpler/Cheaper to manufacture/design.
 - Can go over long distances
 - Stays clockwise/anti-clockwise.
 - Low initial cost.
 - Axes of rotation not needing to be perfectly in line.
 - Quiet.

## Cons
 - Can slip and lose timing, limited amount of force that can be transferred.
 - Worn out much faster than gears as relies on friction.
 - Needs maintenance to adjust the tension.
 - Cannot operate in high temp/wet environments.
