## Intro

The result of applying a load for force to a structural member is a change in length. If a compressive load is applied to a structural member, then the length will reduce. If a tensile load is applied, then the length will increase. **There are no units.**

$$Strain = \frac{Change\ in\  Length}{Length} \quad \quad \varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$$
## Worked Example 1
> A steel wire of length 5m is used to support a tensile load. When the load is applied, the wire is found to have stretched by 2.5mm. Calculate the strain for the wire.

#### Equations to Use/Conversions
$$\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$$
$$2.5mm = 2.5*10^{-3}m$$
#### Workings
$$
\begin{align}
\varepsilon &= \frac{\Delta L}{L} \\
&= \frac{2.5*10^{-3}}{5} \\
&= 0.0005 = 5*10^{-4} \\
\end{align}
$$

## Worked Example 2
> The strain in a concrete column must not exceed $5*10^{-4}$. If the column is 3m high, find the maximum reduction in length when the column is loaded.

#### Equations to Use/Conversions
$$\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$$
$$3m*1000 = 3000mm$$
#### Workings
$$
\begin{align}
\varepsilon &= \frac{\Delta L}{L} \\
\Delta L &= \varepsilon L \\
&= 5*10^{-4}*3000 \\
&= 1.5mm
\end{align}
$$

## Worked Example 3
> An Engineer's research company has submitted a sample for strain testing to your materials testing facility. The sample metal being tested is 500mm in length when no force is applied. However when force/load is applied it stretches to a length of 520mm. What is the strain?

#### Equations to Use/Conversions
$$\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$$

#### Workings
$$
\begin{align}
\varepsilon &= \frac{\Delta L}{L} \\
&= \frac{520 - 500}{500} \\
&= \frac{20}{500} \\
&= 0.04
\end{align}
$$
