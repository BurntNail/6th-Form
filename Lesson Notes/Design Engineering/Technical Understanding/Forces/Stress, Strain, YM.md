It is frequently necessary to calculate the amount by which a part will extend or compress when loaded. We can calculate this using the following equations:
$$Stress[\sigma] = \frac{Force}{CSA}$$

The units are pascals $(Pa)$, which is equal to $\frac{1N}{m^2}$.

This stress will cause the material to undergo strain (stretching).
Strain is described as the change in measurement of a sample of material, when a force is applied.
$$Strain[\varepsilon] = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$$
Strain has no units.
