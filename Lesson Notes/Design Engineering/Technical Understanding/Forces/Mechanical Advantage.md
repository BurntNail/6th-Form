$$Input\ Force * Input\ Speed = Output\ Force * Output\ Speed$$
$$Input\ Force * Distance\ Moved = Output\ Force * Distance\ Moved$$
Therefore, a mechanism can either:
 - Reduce speed, increase force.
 - Increase speed, reduce force.


Mechanical Advantage is the ratio of output force to input force.

$$MA = \frac{Output\ Force}{Input\ Force}$$
$$MA = \frac{Input\ Distance}{Output\ Distance}$$
