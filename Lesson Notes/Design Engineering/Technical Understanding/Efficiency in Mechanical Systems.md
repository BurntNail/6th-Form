An ideal mechanism transfers power without adding or subtracting from it. This implies that it does not lose energy due to friction, or by generating sound or heat, or by flexing the parts or wearing them away. Of course, even with lubrication, friction is always present in real mechanisms and this leads to the output power being less than the input power. The efficiency of a mechanical system is: $Efficiency = \frac{Output Power}{Input Power}$

The efficiencies found in typical gear systems are:
| Thing                                                     | Efficiency |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Epicyclic [[Compound Gear Trains\|Gear Train]]            | 97%        |
| Three-Stage [[Compound Gear Trains\|Compound Gear Train]] | 94%        |
| Worm Drive (can be as low as)                             | 40%        |
