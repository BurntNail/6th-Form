 - Ball bearings consist of a series of metal balls running between 2 races.
 - The inner race turns with the shaft; the outer race is held stationary within the bearing housing.
 - The balls roll (rather than slide) offering very little friction and low wear.
 - Ball bearings handle radial loads well but cannot deal with axial loads; a variation is the cylindrical roller bearing which can handle even higher radial loads.
 - Both types of bearing are lubricated with Grease and may have seals covering the exposed bearings, in which case they are described as sealed bearings. Seals keep the lubricant in and grit and other contaminants out.
