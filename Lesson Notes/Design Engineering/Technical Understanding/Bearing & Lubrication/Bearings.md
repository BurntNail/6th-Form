A bearing is a component which supports a moving part and allows it to move only in the desired motion, with **less friction**.
Bearings are most commonly used to support a Drive [[Shaft]] so it can rotate freely.

See [[Ball & Sealed Bearings]], [[Plain Bearings]]

Most ball bearings cannot withstand axial load, except for [[Tapered Roller & Thrust Bearings]]
