A plain bearing is made by simply passing the shafts through a hardwearing material which also offers low resistance as the shaft rubs against it. Several polymers make popular plain bearings, such as [[Nylon]], PTFE, or polyacetal.
Ideal for low speed, high load applications.
A lubricant such as Oil or Graphite may be used, or the bearing material may be self-lubricating, such as [[Bronze]] which has the property of releasing low-friction material as the bearing wears away.
