## Starter
> Why do materials or systems need reinforcing?

 - To make sure they last a long time
 - To make sure they keep a consistent shape
 - To make sure they are safe to use.
 - To make the best of materials, whilst keeping costs low. (as well as other things like weight).

## Notes
 - We always need to reinforce whilst keeping the context in mind.
 - Keep in mind the #DesignEngineering/Materials/Properties for designing products and choosing #DesignEngineering/Materials . 
 - The idea of increasing [[Tensile Strength]] via Geometry rather than #DesignEngineering/Materials .

## Examples
 - Triangulation in a bike frame
 - Corrugated Cardboard

## Reasons
 - Improve stability
 - Areas prone to high strain/forces
 - Areas likely to see high wear/tear.
 - Improve strength
 - Cope with higher forces
 - Weather or other external loading
 - Excessive Weight
 - Consider the extreme range of stresses that might reasonably occur during use (including those not part of the original design).

> **Good design aims to provide the structural integrity required using the least amount of material.**


## What stresses might a furniture leg see?
 - Force from people sitting down in it.
 - The weight of the object itself.
 - Rain/Wind in an outside environment.
 - Moving it along the ground, torsion force.
 - Natural Disasters like Earthquakes - dynamic rather than static loads.
 - Pets
 - Vacuum Cleaner
