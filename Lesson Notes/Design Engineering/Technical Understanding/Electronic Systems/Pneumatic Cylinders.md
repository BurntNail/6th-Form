Pneumatic Cylinders are linear actuators.

## Single acting cylinder
 - Outstroke under air pressure (strong)
 - Instroke under spring (weak)

## Double acting cylinder
 - Both under air pressure (strong)

 - Distance pushrod moves is called the stroke.
 - Larger diameter pistons have a larger force.

1 is input air, 2 is air from the system, 3 is air out from the system
If you move it along, you change the air flow and pressurisation.


In a 5/2 valve, all the pressure stays within the system, and it just gets moved around.

1 is input air
2 is front end air in
3 is front end air out
4 is back end air in
5 is back end air out



## Force
In a SAC, just use $P = \frac{F}{A}$
In a DAC, you need more pressure at the front end to get it to retract because you can't act on the area underneath the rod, then use $P = \frac{F}{A}$
