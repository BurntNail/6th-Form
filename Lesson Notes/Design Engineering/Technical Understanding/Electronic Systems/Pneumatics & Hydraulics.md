## Pneumatic System
 - A pneumatic system or circuit, is a system that works from stored air pressure. The air pressure is built up using a compressor.
 - The pressurised air can be sent around a circuit, operating a variety of valves and pistons. Pneumatic systems are often seen on production lines, as they are extremely reliable and require very little maintenance.

## Hydraulic Systems
 - Hydraulic systems are similar to pneumatic systems. However, instead of using air to create pressure, they tend to use a fluid, often oil (to avoid corrosion from water).
 - Hydraulic systems tend to be much more powerful than pneumatic systems and this is often the reason for them being used in transport, such as brakes on lorries, or transportable cranes. Hydraulic systems require a compressor, although in place of air, the compressor pressurises fluid (oil), although often pushed by compressed air.
 - The compressor forces the fluid (oil) to enter the chamber of the hydraulic cylinder. Pressure inside the cylinder increases, forcing the piston forward. This is a powerful system.


## Uses Cases
There are 3 basic types of control system - electronic, hydraulic and pneumatic. There isn't a best or worst; it simply depends on the situation and application as to which is most appropriate.

#### Electronic Control
This is best used for accuracy or continuous motion, such as CNC machining and in lift&locate assembly applications.

#### Hydraulic Control
This is best used for heavy loads, up to many tonnes, with immediate response or where precise immediate control is needed. Hydraulic control systems function reliably under adverse conditions such as high and low temperatures, dirt, vibration, moisture & electrical noise.

#### Pneumatic Control
 - Speed & Force can be controlled over a wide range of values.
 - They are intrinsically safe & non-contaminating, in eg. food processing areas or when there is a risk.

## Pros
 - Safe
 - Dependable & Reliable
 - Cheap & Freely available
 - Rapid movement of cylinders
 - Flexible
 - Clean

## Cons
 - Small Forces
 - Not energy efficient
 - Lack of immediate control - *air can become jerky and spongy as the air pressure fluctuates with cylinder movement or load changes*
 - Consequences of Failure
