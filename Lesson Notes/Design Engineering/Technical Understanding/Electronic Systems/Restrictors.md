Pneumatics using stored air pressure can back the pistons very quickly. Whilst this can be advantageous, it can also be dangerous ore prevent the circuit from working properly. To slow down the speed of pistons, we use flow control valves called restrictors.

A restrictor slows down the air going through it in both directions, but a uni-directional restrictor only applies in 1 direction.
