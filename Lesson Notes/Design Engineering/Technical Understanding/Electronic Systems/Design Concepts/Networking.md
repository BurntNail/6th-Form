 - Design systems to be intercompatible (eg. Bluetooth, USB, TCP/IP, Wi-Fi, RFID, etc)
 - Devices must agree on a communication protocol

## Wi-Fi
 - Microwave radio
 - High speed data transfer
 - Range 10-20m
 - Multiple devices concurrently
## Bluetooth
 - Short range between 2 devices
 - Share data or stream music
 - Range 3m
## RFID
 - Radio waves energise tag
 - Pre-programmed data is read from tag
## NFC
 - Like RFID
 - Shorter range - 4cm
 - RW, not just R
