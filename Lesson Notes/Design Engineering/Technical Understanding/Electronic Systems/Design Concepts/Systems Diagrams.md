## How to produce a systems diagram

#### Identify the output devices
 - Digital or analogue?
 - Display or sound?
 - PWM? Servo?
 - Drivers?
#### Identify the input devices
 - What sensors?
 - Calibration?
 - Sensor signals?
#### Identify a microcontroller
 - IO required
 - Compatibility with peripherals?
 - Programming Language?
 - PSU?
 - Speed?
 - Compatibility with Data?
 - Data storage?


## Examples
 - Inputs on left, outputs on right
 - Lines and arrows show signals
 - Signals are electrical voltage and can be digital or analogue
 - IO pins identified as D/A in the diagram
