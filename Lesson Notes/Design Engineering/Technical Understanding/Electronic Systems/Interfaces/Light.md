  - Mainly LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes)
  - Wide range of colours, sizes, brightness and shapes.
  - 'Power' LEDs used to replace filament bulbs - better efficiency, longer life, reduced energy consumption.
  - RGB/Flexible strips available.
  - LEDs need a current-limiting resistor, otherwise they might be damaged.
