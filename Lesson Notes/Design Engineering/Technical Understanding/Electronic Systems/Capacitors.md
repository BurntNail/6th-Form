 - Store electrical charge
 - Units are Farads (F)
 - Ceramic/Polyester ones are non-polarised and smaller, but Electrolytic ones are polarised and bigger.
 - Suppress noise on motors or smooth power supplies
 - Short leg or minus sign indicates negative lead.
 - Notated using OOM - in `(\d\d)(\d)`, `$1` is the number, and `$2` the exponent. Then, we usually get an [[SI Prefixes|SI Prefix]] with the unit - eg. `222pF` is equal to $2200*10^{-12}F = 2.2*10^{-9}F$, also see Surface Mount section here: http://resisto.rs/
