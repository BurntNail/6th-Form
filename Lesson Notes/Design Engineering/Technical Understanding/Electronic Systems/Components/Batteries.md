Consider early in design process - voltage/current/capacity/size/recharging/replacement
Consumable batteries like AA or AAA are usually alkaline (eg. duracell), or zinc chloride. NON-RECHARGABLE
Rechargable - Metal Nickel Hydroxide, Lithium Polymer (LiPo), Lead Acid
How do we recharge? In situ (eg. phone), or remove (eg. rechargable AA AAAs). Trade of space for removing vs additional circuitry. Also trade of whether or not its worth it - watch battery vs phone battery.
