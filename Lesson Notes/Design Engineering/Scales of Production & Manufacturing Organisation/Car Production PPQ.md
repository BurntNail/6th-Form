> Describe the progression of car production over time referencing the Ford Model T and the introduction of JIT in modern Toyota factories. \[10\]

#### Plan:

 
 - Large stock in warehouses (rent, but resiliency, but slow to react)
 - QC (specifically Ford vs Toyota stopping to reduce errors)
 - Planning (less vs more, reactivity, delays)


## Essay

I'd like to compare and contrast 3 main areas in car manufacture that have changed from the times of the Model T - Warehouses, Quality Control, and Planning

Firstly, Warehouses. In the days of the Model T, large warehouses were kept on-site full of stock ready to be used for production of cars. This had lots of advantages, like resiliency against the delays that plague modern factories (that I'll cover later) as they have spare stock they can work with before they need to buy more. However, storing lots of stock in warehouses does have a few disadvantages. Firstly is that you simply need to pay for the space that you are using, be it through rent or lost opportunity cost from space that could've been used for manufacturing. Next, is that since you have a lot of capital tied up in that stock, you can't use that capital for anything else, and you can also lose all of it relatively quickly, be it through people stealing precious metals ranging to natural disasters.

Next, I'd like to briefly touch on Quality Control. To directly compare Toyota and Ford, the company culture in Ford was to keep the assembly line going at all costs, even if that increased the number of failed parts, whereas Toyota allowed employees to stop at any time to fix issues, and also to reduce the chance of those issues happening again in the future, which in the long term increased speed and profits, whilst decreasing wasted material which is not only lost capital but also hard to dispose of.

Finally, I'll talk about planning. Buy-ahead manufacturing has one main planning component which is when you buy the materials - you have to carefully watch the market for when the materials will become cheaper or more expensive and buy lots when it is low. However, beyond that much less planning is needed due to large warehouse spaces acting as buffers for extra finished products or raw materials. However, in JIT manufacturing, planning must be done far in advance of everything to ensure that time is never wasted in the factory and that there is also product. One bonus of JIT manufacturing is that if the raw materials manufacturer has delays or becomes involved in a scandal, you can easily switch to a new provider, rather than having to keep using their products. Finally, JIT manufacturing is more susceptible to freak delays, like when the Suez canal was blocked.
