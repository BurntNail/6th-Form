*Just in time* production means just that - the arrival of parts at just the exact time that they are required in the factory.

#### Pros
 - Money isn't tied up in stock just sitting on shelves - also helpful if demand reduces so you don't just have stuff waiting around.
 - No need to pay for warehouse (staff, rent, security, light)
 - More fault-tolerant - if you discover a fault you can quickly react to change the manufacture.

#### Cons
 - If the demand rises or falls too quickly, things can go wrong.
 - Delays can delay the whole production, eg. suez canal, strikes, weather, transport delays
 - More in-depth planning required
 - Always a risk of running out of stock.
