## Examples
 - Nuts & Bolts
 - Zip fasteners
 - Spark plug
 - Buttons
 - Screws
 - Resistors
 - Electrical Plug

## Pros
 - Often cheaper when brought in due to economies of scale from producers.
 - They all work together - predictability.
 - Ready availability from multiple manufacturers.
 - Consistency - high quality control done by the producer.


## Cons
 - You can't do that for extremely specialised or bespoke products - the whole idea is that they're very generic.
 - Can't 100% trust the tolerances etc on these parts.
