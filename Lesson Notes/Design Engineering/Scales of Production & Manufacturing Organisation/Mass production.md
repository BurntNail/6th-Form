In mass production, large numbers of identical products are made. Production is often continuous, and is suited to high demand, mass market products. Examples include cars, chocolate bars & electronic goods.
 - Minimal product->product variation
 - Usually operate 24/7
 - Requires regular high demand for the product
 - High capital investment, low unit cost
 - Low skilled workforce (repetitive tasks)
 - Low workforce satisfaction
 - Highly efficient control/maintenance staff/controls needed as delays can be costly.
