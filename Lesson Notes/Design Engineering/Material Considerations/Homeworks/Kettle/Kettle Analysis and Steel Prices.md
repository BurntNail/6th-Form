 - Looks nice and sturdy - good for reassuring end users of safety.
 - Will not melt until very high temperatures, so useful for direct contact.

## Handle/Switch/Lid

## Content
In January 2018, as a part of Donald Trump's *America First* campaign goals, Donald Trump imposed sanctions on a list of 279 Chinese products that would have import tariffs for the US. This also applied to lots of UK Steel. 
Whilst he originally proposed this as an attempt to help American Businesses, many testified that this would hurt rather than help them.
The BBC Asia business correspondent pointed out that China couldn't easily match this purely on import tariffs, they could increase red-tape costs for US business in China.
The BBC also predicted that this wouldn't have a large impact on the greater market due to an oversupply of Steel.
