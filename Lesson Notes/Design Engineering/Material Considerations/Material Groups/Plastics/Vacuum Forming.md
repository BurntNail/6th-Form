## Process
1) Place the mould onto the platten, and the plastic sheet into the frame.
2) Turn on the heater to start melting the plastic.
3) Raise the platten to just below the plastic.
4) Turn on the vacuum pump.
5) Turn off the heater, and wait for the plastic to cool before moving the platten back down.

## Advantages
 - Much lower temperatures needed
 - No need for expensive tooling like the other 3 methods
 - Easy to replicate/do in a workshop environment

## Disadvantages
 - Draft angles are needed.
 - Complex and intricate details can be lost (eg. screw threads)
 - A positive mould is needed.
 - Hard to do it at speed.

## How to identify
 - One side (looking from a cube perspective) will have no material.
 - Draft angles, no sharp edges
 - Details through both sides, and no very fine details.
 - No undercuts
