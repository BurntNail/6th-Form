## Process
Thermoplastic pellets pour in from a hopper to enter an Archimedes screw, which moves them horizontally whilst slowly heating them. As the screw goes along, the radius increases to compress the plastic and to encourage it to get out at the end. A continuous sheet of plastic the shape of the end of the screw (or a die plate which is put on top) is then extruded - this means you can only extrude products with a continuous cross-section. Straight after the die is typically a water jacket to cool the plastic into shape.

## How to Identify
 - Continuous Cross-Section
 - No marks around the edges
 - Thermoplastic material (doesn't burn if you try to melt it)
 - Can be solid or hollow.

## Examples
 - Garden Fencing
 - Plastic Tubes (not PVC)
 - Curtain Track
