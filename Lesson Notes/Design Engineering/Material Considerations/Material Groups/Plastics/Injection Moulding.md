## Process
Plastic powder or granules are fed through a hopper into a rotating screw that funnels the plastic pellets to a mould whilst slowly heating them up. That plastic goes through a tube into a mould where it fills the mould. When the mould is full and the plastic is cool enough (happens quickly due to common mould materials (eg. steel) having high thermal conductivity), the far end of the mould moves out of the way, and the push pins eject the plastic piece.

## How to identify
 - Draft Angle on all parts to allow it to release from the mould
 - Possible marks from the push pins.
 - Complex and intricate details.

## Examples
 - Children's toys
 - Phone case
 - Screwdriver handle
