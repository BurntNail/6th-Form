definition:: The ability of a material to be drawn into a length of material with a certain cross-section. It often refers to the ability of a material to be stretched into a wire. Similar to [[Malleability]] - [[Brittleness|Brittle]] materials are not [[Malleability|Malleable]] or Ductile.
example:: To stretch something into a wire, it needs to be ductile. For example, lots of wires used to be made from copper because it was both electrically conductive as well as ductile and cheap.
