definition:: A way of comparing the maximum force the component can withstand to the weight of the component itself
extras:: $$SWR\ [Nmkg^{-1}] = \frac{Strength\ [Nm^{-2}]}{Density}$$
example:: In an airplane you need a material with a high STW ratio to ensure that it can fly using less fuel whilst keeping safety factors the same.
