definition:: When a material has a load applied to it, the load causes the material to deform. Elasticity is the ability of a material to return to its original shape after the load is removed. The elastic limit is the point beyond which permanent deformation takes place.
example:: Elasticity is important in rubber bands - you need to be able to deform it elastically to get it to stretch over some things which you want to keep together, but to then to try to go back to near original length to keep them close together under tension.
