When a material has a load applied to it, the load causes the material to deform. Elasticity is the ability of a material to return to its original shape after the load is removed.
The elastic limit is the point beyond which permanent deformation takes place.

`Young's Modulus` measures the resistance of a material to elastic deformation under load.
$$YM\ [Nm^{-2}] = \frac{Stress}{Strain}$$
$$Stress\ [Nm^{-2}] = \frac{Force}{CSA}$$
$$Strain = \frac{Extension\ [m]}{Original\ Length[m]}$$
