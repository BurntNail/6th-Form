definition:: The ability of a material to resist permanent indentation and abrasive wear.
example:: In a drill bit, we need to ensure that the bit cuts the material rather than the other way around, so we need to use hard materials like diamonds (or more commonly, diamond-tipped hardened steel bits), so they keep the edge for longer. Could also have ceramic tiles on floor which need to not be scratched.
