definition:: The property of a material to deform by compressive forces without developing defects. A malleable material is one that can be stamped, hammered, forged, pressed or rolled into thin sheets.
example:: A material might need to be malleable if it will be worked by hand (eg. with a hammer and anvil), like mild steel. It can then be hardened later when the form is final.
