definition:: The mass per unit volume of a material. It is the compactness or closeness of the structure of the material.
extras:: $$D = \frac{M}{V}$$
example:: Density is an important factor to consider for making things which need to be light or heavy. For example, if a ship needs ballast, they will likely use a material with high density to allow it to take up less space.
