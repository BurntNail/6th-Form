definition:: The maximum shear (opposite forces in a flat plane) strength a material can withstand before it breaks.
example::  2 washers pulling apart a screw in opposite directions. The screw would need to have high shear strength to withstand the forces. Scissors provide a shear force, papers have poor shear strength.
