definition:: The opposite of [[Plasticity]]. A brittle metal is one that breaks or shatters before it deforms. White [[Cast Iron]] and Glass are good examples of Brittle Materials.
example:: Thin glass is very brittle as it is easy to snap, in contrast to a rubber band which can stretch a long way before snapping.
