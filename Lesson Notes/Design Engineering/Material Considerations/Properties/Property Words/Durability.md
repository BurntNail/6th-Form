definition:: The ability to withstand wear or damage. Also refers to the ability to withstand weathering and to last. Also lonegevity.
example:: For high-quality products, you need high durability to ensure the product lasts a long time. For example, children's blocks might be made from wood over plastic as most woods are more durable and so last for longer. Tungsten drill-bits are really durable and last a long time. Limestone has poor chemical longevity, as it is easily eroded by weak acids. See Breaking Bad - polypropylene is durable against strong acids.
