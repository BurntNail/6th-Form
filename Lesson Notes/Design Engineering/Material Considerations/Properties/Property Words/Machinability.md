definition:: The capability of a material to be cut or shaped by machine tools. Materials with greater performance characteristics and enhanced properties are most likely to have poor machinability.
example:: If a project will be machined rather than cast, we need to use machinable materials to ensure that the machinability does not affect the finish or the structural integrity of the product.
