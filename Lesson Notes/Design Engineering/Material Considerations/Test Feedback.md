[[DE Chap 5 Test.pdf]]

 - Polyester isn't stretchy unless blended with something like Lycra.
 - Concrete is a good example of a #DesignEngineering/Materials/Composites 
 - [[Glass Reinforced Plastic|GRP]] is a #DesignEngineering/Materials/Composites not a Thermoset Plastic
 - Properties should be related to the uses and relevant.

 - [[Hardness]] needs a ref to impact resistance.
 - Biodegradation needs a ref to a scenario where it'd biodegrade - air, water and a consumer are needed.

 - Mechanical Properties are reacting to forces, eg. strength
 - Chemical Properties are reacting to substances, eg. chemical resistance
 - Physical Properties are the properties when not reacting, eg. Weight, [[Density]]
 - Manufacturing involves cutting, moulding and joining, eg. [[Machinability]], Fusability

 - Ideally 3 examples to backup points.
 - Cohesive argument explained clearly.
 - Use of technical language including material names, links to fair trade specifics relating to material sourcing.

 - Reference to [[Steel]] vs [[Aluminium]] incl [[Steel#Variations]]. Dicussions of pros+cons of each
 - Specific #DesignEngineering/Materials/Plastics  identified & justified incl interior polymers (likely to be thermosets if in contact with electrical components)
 - #DesignEngineering/Materials/Metals  finishes justified
 - #DesignEngineering/Materials/Properties/PropertyWords used correctly, eg. Coefficient of Friction when discussing rubber.
