A big factor that limits the usable life of engineered products is the technical capability with newer systems.  eg. vinyl disk, magnetic tape, CD, minidisk, mp3, streaming
Destructive technologies tend to cause incompatibility between old and new, as technologies can be completely different.
However, it is generally beneficial to maintain a degree of compatibility to encourage loyalty in existing customers and confidence in the brand.
Designing products to be compatible with older versions is called backwards compatibility.
Also think about new updates slowing down phones, or new connection/protocol standards.
