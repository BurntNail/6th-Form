## Introduction

Tungsten is a chemical element with the symbol W, identified in 1781 and isolated in 1783. Common Ores include Scheelite and Wolframite. Tungsten is commonly used for its robustness and high melting point/boiling point.

### Uses
 - Incandescent Light Bulb Filaments
 - X-Ray Tubes
 - Electrodes in Gas Tungsten arc-welding
 - Radiation Shielding

## Production
### Reserves
$3.2*10^6$ tonnes, mainly in China, Canada, Russia, Vietnam and Bolivia. China, Vietnam, Russia lead suppliers, Canada stopped in 2015 after a mine closure. China is also the leader in export/consumption.

Tungsten is also considered a conflict mineral due to unethical practices in the DRC.

## Extraction
Tungsten is usually extracted in stages, which is eventually converted to *Tunsten (VI) Oxide $(\ce{ WO_{3} })$*, which is heated with $\ce{ H_{2} }$ or $\ce{ C }$ to produce powdered tungsten. Due to the high melting point, ingots are not produced, and instead the tungsten is mixed with powdered nickel or other metals and sintered.

### Sintering
This is where metals are put under intense pressure so that they fuse and mix to one solid piece without melting. One common example of sintering is ice cubes in a glass of water.
