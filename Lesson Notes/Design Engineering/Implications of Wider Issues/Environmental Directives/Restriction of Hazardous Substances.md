[[@RegulationsRestrictionHazardous]]

Products must have technical documentation to prove compliance.

Covers:
- some equipment for military use or specifically designed to be sent into space
- products integral to equipment that is not covered by the regulations
- large-scale stationary industrial tools and large-scale fixed installations
- photovoltaic (solar) panels produced for permanent use at specific locations
- means of transport (apart from certain two-wheeled electric vehicles)
- non-road mobile machinery specifically for professional use
- products specifically for research and development available on a business-to-business basis
- pipe organs
- active implantable medical devices


Basically, making sure that products do not exceed levels of toxic chemicals (eg. 0.01% cadmium, 0.1% lead)
