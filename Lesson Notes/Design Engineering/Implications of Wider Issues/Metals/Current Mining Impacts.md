## Surface
 - Mining sector responsible for the largest releases of heavy metals and air pollutants.
 - [[Lead]], Cadmium, Mercury associated with neural issues, and silica dust associated with lung cancer.
 - Open pit mining requires lots of vegetation to be removed.
 - Bauxite found near surface, so less impact, but makes up as lots of energy in electrolysis to get [[Aluminium]].
 - Lots of materials needed for phones expected to run out in next 10-20 years, see [[@AppleExpandsGlobal]]

## Underground
 - Deep ocean floor has lots of minerals, but we could lose species before we even classify them
 - eg. [[Zinc]], [[Gold]], [[Silver]], [[Lead]], Cobalt
