# Extraction
Must drill oil.
Get wood from forests.

# Refinement
Pulp Wood.
Fractionally Distillation of oil.

# Manufacture
Lots of steps, lots of time to get plastic and wood to one place.
[[Polystyrene|PS]] for Lid, [[Polyethylene|PE]] for Inner Coating, [[Common Woods|Pulped Wood]] for cup/holder.

# Distribution
Distributed all over the world, but low-order good so likely sea shipping which is less bad than something like air travel.

# Use
Very few emissions during use.

# EOL
1 in 400 are recycled, and plastic inner coating makes it tricky to recycle.
