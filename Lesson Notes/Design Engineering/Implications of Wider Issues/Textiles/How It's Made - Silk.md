## Intro
 - Started in China 5k years ago
 - Very luxurious
 - Made by silkworms when they cocoon.
 - Mainly made in Asian countries.
 - To stop the larva from pupating into a moth, they boil them inside their cocoons.

## Manufacture
 - To get a strand of silk, threads are taken from 30-50 cocoons and put together onto a hand-operated wheel. The 'glue' that is used to keep it together in the cocoon melts when boiling, and then as the strand is made that glue re-hardens to make one solid strand.
 - It takes 2-3k cocoons to make 1lb of silk thread.
 - A single thread can be as long as 9 pro football fields.
 - It is easier to wind if it is weighed down with sand, so once wound it is washed to remove the sand and glue. This also mixes in the dye, which will then be even.
 - The silk is then left to dry.
 - Then, it is transferred to smaller rollers, which then go to small bobbins and spools.
