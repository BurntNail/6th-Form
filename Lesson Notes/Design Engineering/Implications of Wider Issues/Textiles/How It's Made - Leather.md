## Intro
 - Used to be made by rubbing fat into animals' skins
 - Strong to take lots of abuse
 - Still commonly used today

## Manufacture
 - Often comes from the hides of cows killed for meat, and without tanning they'd go to waste - kinda recycling.
 - The hides are first cut in half using a sawhorse, and ID is stamped onto them. They're sliced to make them easier to handle.
 - They load hundreds of hides at a time into a modified cement mixer to remove the hair. The mixer is filled with water, and then sodium salt hydrate and lime are added. 
 - They bathe the skins in acid in order to prepare them to absorb the tanning salts.
 - The tanning happens inside wooden barrels with large prongs which keep the skins from getting tangled. The chrome tanning salts then turn the hides blue. They're now leather.
 - They feed the leather into a machine that splits it into layers. It slices the leather on the flesh side to an even thickness. The cutoffs can then get recycled into suede.
 - Then they get re-tanned with vegetable extract, tree bark, dyes, water and chemicals for water resistance. This gives them their brown tint. This also softens the leather.
 - They then brush a mix of starch and water onto the tanned hides. This allows them to press the hides onto a sheet of glass moistened with the same solution. This then allows them to dry flat, without shrinking and the ends won't curl up. Between each drying, the glass is wiped clean, and re-sprayed.
 - They dry for 4 hours, and then easily peel away from the glass.
 - The colour is then further enhanced by spraying dye onto the leather.
 - They're then polished by being systematically put underneath a glass tube, and the friction polishes them.
 - Finally, huge heated rollers smooth out any wrinkles.
