## Intro
 - Wools have an oily protective layer, and when removed the grease is processed into a hand cream layer
 - 4000BC started spinning into yarn for fabric
 - Wool & Fabrics large historical export for UK
 - Exported sheep to Australia, turned into world's largest wool industry 

## Properties
 - Durable
 - Wrinkle-proof
 - Holds shape well
 - Insulates against heat/cold
 - Used for sweaters/coats

## Manufacture
 - Fleece removed in one piece by hand.
 - Graded on length, colour, waviness & fine-ness.
 - Different grades/materials mixed in different proportions for different uses
 - Transferred by air pipes, and kept lubricated.
 - Fibres carefully detangled/made parallel and debris is removed.
 - This makes a smooth flat sheet called a web.
 - This is then divided into thin/flat strips, which are twirled into thin/round strips, which are wound onto a spool.
 - These strips look like yarn, but fall apart when pulled, as they haven't yet been spun to give them strength.
 - The strips are stretched, spun, and re-wound, and they are now strong.
 - All wool fabrics undergo finishing, to get a smooth/flat/sheared finish.
