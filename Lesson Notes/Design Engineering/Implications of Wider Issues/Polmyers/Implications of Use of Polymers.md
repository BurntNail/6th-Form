## General
 - Difference with recycling/use on [[Thermoset Polymers]] vs [[Thermopolymers]].
 - Mostly made from **oil**, but can be made from biomass.
 - Production & Disposal a major problem as many end up in streams and kill fish, which we eat.
 - Around $300*10^6$ tons are produced, but $\gt 8*10^6$ tons which are thrown away end up in oceans.
 - Around $50\%$ of polymers are estimated to only be used once.
