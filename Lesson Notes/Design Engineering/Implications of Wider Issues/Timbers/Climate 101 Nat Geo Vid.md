## Intro
 - Forests cover 30% of the planet
 - At current rate, world's rainforests gone in 100 yrs.
 - Forestry & Agriculture responsible for 24% of emissions
 - More than half of all the rainforest in the world is in the Amazon.

## Impact
 - When trees are felled, they release their stored carbon into the atmosphere.
 - Fewer forests, mean more GGs entering the atmosphere.
 - Forests provide habitats for 20% of all animals that live on land.
 - 4-6k rainforest species go extinct each year.

## Causes
 - Biggest cause of Deforestation of farmers, for soy/palm/cattle
 - Loggers also cut lots of trees each year
 - Also due to Urban Sprawl

## Solutions
 - Effects not irreversible - no clear cutting, replace trees
