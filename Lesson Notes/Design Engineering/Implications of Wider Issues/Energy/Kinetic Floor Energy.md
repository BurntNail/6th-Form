Kinetic panels are placed on the floors of concerts/clubs/parties. As people dance on them, the up/down [[Reciprocating Motion]] moves a magnet up and down through a coil, generating electricity.

This was used at Coldplay Concerts, where the dancing would help to run the concert. Future plans include paving with this in floors of office blocks/pavements.

# Pros
 - Very passive
 - Small, sleek, unobstrusive

# Cons
 - £80/sqft, but prices still coming down - was £1700/sqft in 2009.
 - Short lifespan of about 5 years leads to regular replacement.
 - Each compression doesn't produce much current, so you need lots of them to get any useful amount of electricity.
