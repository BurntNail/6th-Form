A species of jellyfish contains a specific protein called `Green Flourescent Protein (GFP)`, which makes them glow green when exposed to light. When this is applied to aluminium electrodes it generates power. Swedish scientists have looked into extracting the GFP from the jellyfish to make miniature fuel cells, for medical industry uses.

# Pros


# Cons
 - Very small power output.
 - Yet to be scaled up.
 - Requires advanced infrastructure so very expensive.
