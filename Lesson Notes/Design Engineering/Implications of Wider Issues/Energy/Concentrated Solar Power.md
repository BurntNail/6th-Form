This focuses mainly on Tower CSP, which uses heliostats (which are mirrors that can rotate), which all rotate around to face the top of a tower. In the top of the tower, there is blocks of  salt, which is a very good conductor, which passes through a radiator and heats up water, boils, steam, turbines, generator, electricity. When demand is low, there are storage tanks which can store the molten salt for about 16 hours.

China plans to make 13 CSP stations 1.1GW total, each of which can power 900k homes.

 - Low operating costs.
 - High efficiency
 - Scalable to the 100MW+ level.

# Cons

 - Very expensive - China's plans will cost billions.
 - No energy produced overnight.
 - Needs to be remote as needs lots of land
