# The Process
## General
Geothermal Energy is the thermal energy inside the Earth's crust that comes from a mix of tectonic activity and radioactive decay. As the hot parts of the crust heat, they can deform and rise higher up, whilst maintaining high temperatures. At these spots, we can harvest Geothermal Energy. 

## Specific
Reykjanes is located in Iceland, famed for its volcanic and tectonic activity, and so is the perfect location for geothermal plants. As of such, this is only one of their more recent plants, and Iceland has 6 Geothermal Plants ranging from 60MW (in Krafla) to 303MW (in Hellisheiði) .[[@askjaIcelandicPowerPlants2011]]

The plant uses steam/water extracted from its 12 wells, each 2700m deep. After the water/steam mix has risen to the surface, it is taken to a steam separator. Once the steam is isolated, it passes under 19 bars of pressure to a steam dryer and the 2 50MW turbines.

Due to the proximity of the plant to the seafront, water can be easily pumped in for cooling and condensing at 4000l/s.

# Advantages
 - Little environmental impact, all of which is reversible, unlike Hydroelectric power.
 - Very stable and consistent cost/output.
 - There is still a large number of places that could be outfitted with power.
 - No continued fuel required, only maintenance.
 - Still a new technology, so lots of improvements to be made.

# Disadvantages
 - Location Restricted - unlike a coal power plant, you can't just drop a Geothermal plant anywhere, as it has to have enough tectonic activity easily accessible to be feasible. This is why Iceland has so many plants.
 - Whilst there is no $CO_2$ directly released, many gases stored in the Earth's crust can be released. Whilst this isn't anywhere near the output of a fossil fuel plant, it is still a factor to consider.
 - High costs for building a new plant, due to costs to drill down deep.
