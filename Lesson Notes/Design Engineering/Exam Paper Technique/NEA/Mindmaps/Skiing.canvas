However, not everybody even knows about them, and they can be very expensive.\n\nAlso - these are largely ineffective for tree wells as nobody will know to look for you, unless they see you on the run as they go down.","id":"39b083b569536d2e","x":-178,"y":-549,"width":506,"height":263},
		{"type":"text","text":"Avalanche control is the practice of controlled explosions to cause avalanches whilst the ski area is unoccupied to ensure that avalanches do not occur whilst the ski area is occupied.\n\nThese can either be set off from people dropping them from helicopters on timed fuses, throwing them over cliffs, or in particularly avalanche vulnerable areas, cable lines are set up to drop lots of explosives into a wide area, or even avalaunchers which propel large grenades from a barrel to hit certain areas.\n\nHowever, this comes with some inherent risks, like what if people are in the ski area, or the explosives fail to detonate. The former could cause death and the latter could cause people to be skiing near undetonated explosives, so resorts that use this technique are often littered with signs with photos and illustrations of undetonated explosives to warn users of the risk and what not to touch.","id":"5c8496f94194428a","x":-999,"y":120,"width":813,"height":317},

As they fall down, they bring more snow in to make the problem exponentially worse as the avalanche goes on. People get caught up in the avalanches, where they get thrown around so thoroughly that a common problem is people digging themselves deeper because they cannot tell which way is up and down.
