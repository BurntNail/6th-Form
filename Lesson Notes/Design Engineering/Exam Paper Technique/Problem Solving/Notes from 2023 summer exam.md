### Q1
- For anthropometrics/ergonomics - make sure to reference the data given in the booklet and how it applies.
- Make sure to reference the wider context
- Why materials as well for context - eg. aluminium > steel for sea
- Remember ACCESSFM

### Q2
 - Proof Q: `Determine by Calculation` - 
$$\begin{align*}
M &= 80 + 3 + 12 \\
&= 95 \pu{kg} \\ \\
B &= \rho Vg \\
V &= \frac{B}{\rho g} \\
&= \frac{95 * 9.81}{1025*9.81} \\
&= 0.0926 \pu{m^3} = 93 \pu{l} \\
\text{Doubled} &= 186 \pu{l}
\end{align*}$$
Board 14

### Q3
You don't need to know a whole lot about the context, there is a fair bit of ticking boxes.
 - The 2 questions are both worth about 8 marks.

##### Sensor Sketch
2 main problems for : identify how to attach to the board, and how to sense the water speed - 4 marks each

**Attachment**:
 - How to attach
 - How to detach
 - Does it interfere/damage the board
 - Materials

**Sensing**:
 - Sensor Type
 - Position on board
 - Conversion from sensor-data
 - How does the output signal change with speed?


##### Microcontroller
Same as the sensor - 4 for the flowchart, and 4 for the circuit diagram

##### Flowchart:
 - Variables
 - Outputs
 - Outputs off
 - Read the sensor

##### Circuit Diagram:
 - Power
 - How is the input sensor connected?
 - How are the LEDs connected?
 - LED polarity + protective resistors

Make sure you get all of the correct symbols like Physics.



### Q4
Enterprise
 - Entrepreneurship
 - Commercial Partnerships
 - VC
 - Crowdfunding
Make sure to mention the speedometer thingie!
