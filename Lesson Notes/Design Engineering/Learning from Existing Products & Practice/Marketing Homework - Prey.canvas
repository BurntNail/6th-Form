Both the publishing studio and development studio had strong pedigrees, so the auditorium they had booked filled up as fans eagerly waited.\n\nHere, Arkane got their first opportunity to show the feel of the game's environment, which was to be strongly Art-Deco themed, set in 2032. This was also reinforced by the Prey booth.\n\nThe announcement went well, along with a release year - 2017.\n\nOver the next 2 months, more videos were released about the concept and focusing in details of the trailer","id":"85bcee697d5deab8","x":-5425,"y":-160,"width":720,"height":360},

For example, if I need to get into a locked room, I could look around for a vent to climb through if I specialised in opening vents. I could hack the door lock to get in that way. I might even be able to speak to a nearby person if I had spoken with lots of other people to have more knowledge to persuade them to open the door for me.\n","id":"0814d225e2e6e7f1","x":-1475,"y":-1073,"width":438,"height":420},
