Unfortunately, I originally did this in a different ON page, and so have redone it here without photos. They are all both in that page and [here](https://drive.proton.me/urls/P70R51Q84C#KdkSotNxWaRo).

# How does the product work?
The product works via collecting electricity into a capacitor, and discharging it into an LED when a switch is pushed. It can be charged by using a hand crank dynamo combination or an included solar panel.

#### What subsystems are there, can you explain them?
There are 3 main subsystems:
 - Firstly, there is the hand crank. This is on a hinge and flips out from the main shell to be spun around by the end user. This then drives a gear train devised to minimise torque and maximise speed (low mechanical advantage). These gears then drive a dynamo which generates electricity which is sent to the capacitors.
 - Next, there is the solar panel, which generates electricity from the sun which is sent to the capacitors.
 - Finally, there is the PCB and switch, which control when and how power is sent around the board. For example when the switch is pushed, power is sent to the LEDs.
#### Ergonomics/Anthropometrics
The product has been designed with both in mind. For example, the product neatly fits into my hand, showing a knowledge of hand sizes. They likely went for a smaller design over larger due to the fact that some might see this as a toy for children, who need to be able to hold it without dropping it. I can also see that ergonomics have been considered because it is very easy to open the clip as well as keep a strong grip on it due to the large exterior ribs.


# How is it made?
The product is likely made either via injection moulding or 3D printing, more likely injection moulding. I can tell this because I can see high detail on the inside of the product as well as a clear draft angle designed to make mould release easier. However, I can also see layer lines which suggests 3D printing. Overall, also considering the scale of manufacture, I'd say injection moulding.

#### Why have these methods been used?
Injection Moulding has been used in order to get high levels of interior detail at a mass scale of manufacture.
#### Are there signs of wear? What might this tell you?
For signs of wear, I can't see very much which suggests a high manufacture quality. This is also likely due to the aesthetic choice to use a rough, matte surface finish which can hide deformations and scratches.
#### Are there legal requirements associated with this product?
Other than advertising standards, this product does not have to follow any legal standards.
#### What cost restrictions might a manufacturer have to consider?
The manufacture has to consider that lots of people going camping might not want to spend lots of money on a good, modern flashlight. They also have to consider that the cost of good flashlights is always falling and so they have to carefully price to fall in the middle. Finally, considering the sub-par intensity of light, they also have to price such that they won't receive many negative reviews.


# Component parts?
The flashlight is made up of many different component parts:
 - 4 gears
 - 5 rods (4 for gears, 1 for clip)
 - 4 shell pieces (2 main, 2 clips)
 - PCB
 - Clear LED Cover
 - Mirror-like LED Diffuser
 - Rubber top piece
 - Spring
 - Capacitor Bank
 - Dynamo

#### Materials used? Why?
 - Polypropylene was likely used for the outer shell, as high temperature resistance isn't important because LEDs do not produce much heat. 
 - Most PCBs are made from fibreglass and copper.
 - The gears are likely made from nylon as it is self-lubricating.
 - Most of the interior of the product was covered in grease, which likely aided the gears spinning smoothly and also likely aids somewhat in light waterproofing.
#### Think about form/function
Most of the flashlight appears to have been designed with function forward (common in low-order products),  with all of the components just fitting inside the shell, and the outside shell having a basic cylindrical shape.
#### Manufacture method
The flashlight was likely made by injection moulding for reasons above.
#### Structural integrity
Inside the product, I can see lots of sprues to increase rigidity as well as holes for pins to go in which keep the components in place.
#### Measurements (dimensions, gear ratios, voltage, surface area etc)
I didn't take any measurements.
#### Scientific principles (e.g. Mechanical advantage)
The interior gears are designed to minimise mechanical advantage to spin the dynamo as fast as possible.

# Marketing?
For marketing, I haven't seen any ads for it, and the product page from the company seems quite sparse beyond very basic product specifications. The amazon page seems to be relying on good reviews and keywords in the product title.
#### Who is the product aimed at?
The product seems to be aimed at casual campers who need a flashlight for non-vital uses occasionally.
