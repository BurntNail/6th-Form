#### Introduction
 - Highest monetary investment at this stage
 - Research undertaken to gather information from target market prototyping stage to help with market penetration.

###### Price Strategies
 - Price skimming - highest price charged and slowly reduced until optimum sales reached.
 - Penetration pricing - starts at a low price, then gradually increases (mainly used in saturated markets)


#### Growth
 - Popularity of product is increasing.
 - Competitors may introduce products - it is crucial not only to maintain sales, but also to attract the competitor's consumers
 - Often done by ads/marketing
 - Also the ideal time to make improvements to the product, possibly requiring further investment.


#### Maturity
 - Sales start to reduce and profit margins decline
 - Could be due to market saturation, or the introduction of new competitive products
 - To hold their position, companies can still maintain sales and attract attention by doing things such as expanding to new international markets or introduce new features.
 - It is here that products & sales are most vulnerable - next generation product/technology needed before decline.


#### Decline
 - Market is saturated or competitors have taken a larger portion of the sales.
 - Companies must predict this so that they have an exit strategy to prevent profit loss.
 - Exit strategies normally coincide with the introduction of a new product.
 - The rate of the decline depends on the product.

## Methods used to create demand and maintain popularity
 - Increasing the use of products through add-ons or accessories
 - Reducing price
 - Adapting the original product to ensure it has a USP.
 - Introducing promotional offers
 - Introducing new advertising
 - Change image or branding to appeal to a new target market
 - Staying up-to-date with the latest technology so customers will think they have the latest version
 - Attracting new markets - with the growth in the number of online shoppers, more organisations sell their products through the internet.
