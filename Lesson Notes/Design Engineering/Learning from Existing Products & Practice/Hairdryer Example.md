## Plug
 - Has proper grounding on the plug level with prong sizes
 - Can see injection moulded from pin marks
 - IC to control plug
 - Wire has protective piece to allow it to flex

## Hairdryer
 - Loop for hanging
 - Screen on back air intake to clear
 - Chrome-plated screws to stop rusting in moist bathroom environment
 - Also injection moulded - can tell because high detail.
 - [[Polypropylene]]
 - Lots of little bits on the inside to provide Rigidity, and for keeping with the other half.
 - Cord on the inside tied up so wire can't get pulled away.
 - Internal Mica sheet to protect the interior of the hair dryer from the hot air.
 - Painted steel bracket on the front.
 - Used the heater as a resistor for the motor.
 - Nichrome wire used for heating - very effective at getting hot from electricity, but doesn't rust.
 - Bimetallic Strip as a safety measure. Different expansion rates, so it bends and when it gets too hot then it shuts it off.
