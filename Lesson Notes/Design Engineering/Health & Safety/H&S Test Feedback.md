Hazards - reference to danger - [[Severity]]
Risk - reference to chance/probability - [[Likelihood]]
Control Measure - some ref to problem solving


## 4
Control Measures in the workshop:
 - Foot stops in place and on switches for machines with additional cover on/off switch
 - Scroll saw equipped with guard
 - Belt sander placed at lower working height to account for taller platen
 - Signage for goggles
 - High grip floor surface
 - Equipment is hard-wired, with protective sheaths around wires.
 - Adequate lumen lighting above work stations.
 - Machines fixed to table - limited movement from vibration/tipping.
 - Belt guard on belt sander. Minimal gap between belt and platen.
 - Dust extraction on both machines. Suction quality trackable through gages.
 - Could improve signage on floor for no-go zones.
