Effectively the same as [[Lesson Notes/Design Engineering/Material Considerations/British Standards]]

 - Specifications (v prescriptive)
 - Codes of Practice (eg. hygiene rating)
 - Agreed Methods (eg. advisory of how to do things, like manufacturing methods in factories)
 - Guides (less prescriptive)

 - Talk about flammability of stuff.
