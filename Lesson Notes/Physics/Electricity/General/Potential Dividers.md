Assuming a circuit with one battery and two resistors ($R_1$ and $R_2$) in series, where $V_{in}$ is the Potential Difference across the battery and $V_1$ and $V_2$ are the Potential Differences across $R_1$ and $R_2$ respectively.


Using $V=IR$ for the whole circuit, as current is the same through all components.
$$V_{in} = I(R_1 + R_2) \to I = \frac{V_{in}}{R_1 + R_2}$$
$\therefore$ the potential across each component is:
$$V_1 = IR_1 \to V_1 = \frac{V_in}{R_1+R_2}R_1 \quad \quad V_2 = IR_2 \to V_2 = \frac{V_{in}}{R_1 + R_2}R_2$$
