> Determination of [[Resistivity]] of a wire using a micrometer, ammeter and voltmeter

|CPAC Objective|Description|
|--|--|
|2c|Identifies and controls significant quantitative variables where applicable, and plans approaches to take account of variables that cannot readily be controlled.|
|2d|Selects appropriate equipment and measurement strategies in order to ensure suitably accurate results. |
|4b|Obtains accurate, precise and sufficient data for experimental and investigative procedures and records this methodically using appropriate units and conventions.|
|5a|Uses appropriate software and/or tools to process data, carry out research and report findings.|
|5b|Sources of information are cited demonstrating that research has taken place, supporting planning and conclusions.|

# Variables
|Variables|Description|Method|Values/Range|

|Independent| Length of the Wire|Move around the crocodile clips to change the length of the wire through which current flows. |0.1-0.8m|
|Dependent| Resistivity of the Wire| Use the equation |??|
|Control| Wire Material/Wire Radius/Temperature|Ensure room temperature stays constant. Use the same wire every time|N/A|

# Method
We will place the nicrome wire within the jaws of a micrometre. We are using a digital  micrometre, so we must zero out the scale beforehand, and then read the reading  from the display. We got 0.41mm which is the diameter. Since the micrometre  measures up to 0.01mm, we can say that the result was 0.41 ± 0.01mm. However,  to get the cross-sectional area of the nicrome wire we need to get the radius,  so we divide by 2 to get 0.205 with a relative uncertainty of 4.9%. Then we can  use the equation for the area of a circle to get 0.13 mm^2 with 9.8%  uncertainty, or 0.13 mm^2 ± 0.01mm
