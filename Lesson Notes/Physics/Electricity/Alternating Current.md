## Intro

An alternating current is one which periodically changes direction.
It can be measured using an [[Oscilloscope]].

Now hard to do lots of calculations because it is variable. 

## rms

The $rms$ is the Root Mean Squared.

The $rms$ value of an alternating current supply is the value of a direct supply that would produce the same heating effect as the alternating current  in the same resistor.

$$V_{rms} = \frac{V_{peak}}{\sqrt{2}} \quad \quad I_{rms} = \frac{I_{peak}}{\sqrt{2}} \quad \quad P_{average} = \frac{P_{peak}}{2}$$
