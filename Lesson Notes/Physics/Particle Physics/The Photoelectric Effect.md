 - Photons of light with a high enough frequency/energy incident on a metal surface can cause the emission of electrons, from that surface. 
 - This only happens to electrons **near** the surface. 
 - Every metal has a different *work function* $(\phi)$, for the minimum energy required by an electron to escape the metal's surface.

The following is true, where $E$ is the energy of the photon, and $E_k$ is the kinetic energy of the photo-electron. 
$$E = hf = \phi + E_k$$

 - Increasing the intensity has no effect if the energy isn't above the work function. If the photon energy is greater than the work function, increasing the intensity causes more electrons to be released. It is a one-to-one relationship.
 - A range of kinetic energies are produced because some electrons move from further inside the metal.
