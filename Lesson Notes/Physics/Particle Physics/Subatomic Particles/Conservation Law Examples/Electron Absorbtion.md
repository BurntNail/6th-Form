$$p + e^- \to n + x$$

| Conserved | Proton | [[Electron]] | Neutron  | $x$ |
| --------- | ------- | ------ | ------------ | -------------------------- | 
| Q         | +1       | -1     | 0           | 0                          | 
| B         | +1      | 0     | +1            | 0                          | 
| L         | 0       | -1      | 0           | -1                         | 

We can therefore tell that $x$ is an [[Electron Neutrino]]
