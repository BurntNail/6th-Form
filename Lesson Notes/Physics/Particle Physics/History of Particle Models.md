## Dalton
Main points:
 - Elements are made from extremely small particles called Atoms.
 - Atoms of a given element are identical in size, mass and other properties, which all differ from atoms from other elements.
 - Atoms cannot be subdivided, created or destroyed.
 - Atoms of different elements combine in whole-number ratios to create chemical compounds.
 - In chemical reactions, atoms are combined, separated or rearranged.

## Thompson
J.J. Thompson did an experiment where cathode rays were suggested to be over 1000x lighter than hydrogen atoms, but also that those rays were the same mass regardless of whatever item those rays came from, suggesting subatomic units 1000x smaller than atoms.
He was also responsible for the plum pudding model, where subatomic particles are spread throughout the atom like fruit pieces in a plum pudding.

## Rutherford
He disproved Thompson, by using a gold foil in a circular screen, and checking how many alpha particles were deflected. The lack of deflection proved that atoms are mainly empty space. The angles of deflection proved that there must be magnetic charges interacting.

## Bohr
The Bohr model is Old Quantum Theory - where centres of atoms are surrounded by electrons all in discrete energy levels, which can change the properties of those elements. Those electrons can then change energy levels and emit a quantum (the smallest quantity) of energy.

## Schrodinger
The start of general relativity, starting the idea that quantum things can be both particles and waves.
