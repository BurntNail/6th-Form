Electrons exist in energy levels around the nucleus of an atom. The lowest energy level is called the ground state. Electrons can be excited to higher energy states.

$1\pu{eV} = 1.6*10^{-19}\pu{J}$

The ground state ($n=0$) of a hydrogen atom is $-13.6\ \pu{eV}$.
Then, when the electron goes up a level ($n=1$), the state is $-3.4\pu{eV}$.
$n=2 \to -1.5\pu{eV}$, and this continues until it is ionised and reaches $0\pu{eV}$, which makes sense as it takes less and less energy to move an electron the farther it is from the nucleus.

## How is the photon excited

 - By the absorption of a photon with exactly the required energy.
 - Collision with an external electron - the external electron transfers exactly the required energy from its kinetic store, moving off at a reduced speed.

## How does a fluorescent light work?

Inside of the light, there is a large pd between 2 terminals with a very low pressure of mercury gas inside. As the electrons go through, they excite the mercury which releases UV light. That then excites phosphors painted on the outside with exactly the energy to make them emit 2 lower energy photons.

Neon does the same, but you don't need the phosphor.
