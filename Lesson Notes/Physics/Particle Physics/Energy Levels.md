Electrons exist in energy levels around the nucleus of an atom. The lowest energy level is called the ground state. Electrons can be excited to higher energy states.

$1\pu{eV} = 1.6*10^{-19}\pu{J}$

The ground state ($n=0$) of a hydrogen atom is $-13.6\ \pu{eV}$.
Then, when the electron goes up a level ($n=1$), the state is $-3.4\pu{eV}$.
$n=2 \to -1.5\pu{eV}$, and this continues until it is ionised and reaches $0\pu{eV}$, which makes sense as it takes less and less energy to move an electron the farther it is from the nucleus.
