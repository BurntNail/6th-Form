- Unit of Electric Current
- A

The ampere is defined as the current flowing in 2 parallel wires 1m apart in a vacuum such that there is an attractive force of $2.0*10^{-7}$  per metre length of wire between them.
Or, 1 A is the same as 1 [[Electric Charge|Coulomb]] pf charge passing a point in 1 second.

An ammeter should have very low resistance and be connected in series.
