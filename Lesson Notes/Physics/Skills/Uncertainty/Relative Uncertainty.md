The relative percentage of uncertainty for a measurement.
= [[Absolute Uncertainty]] / Value
 - For example, if I have a millimetre graded ruler, the [[Absolute Uncertainty]] is 0.1cm
 - If I measure an object to be 5.6cm, the value is then 5.6cm.
 - Then, to get the Relative Uncertainty: $= 0.1 / 5.6 = 1.79\%$
