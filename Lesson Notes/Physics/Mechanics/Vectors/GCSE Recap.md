 - Scalars are quantities which only have magnitude.
 - Vectors are quantities which have both direction and magnitude.

Examples:
| Scalar Quantities | Vector Quantities |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Energy            | Displacement      |
| Charge            | Velocity          |
| Speed             | Acceleration      |
| Distance          | Jerk              |
| Mass              | Snap              |
| Temperature       | Crackle           |
| Time              | Pop               |
| Density           | Force             |
| Pressure          | Weight            |
|                   | Momentum          |
