title: "Coltan and Mobile Phones: The Wonders & the Sad Truth About It"
abstract: "When talking about the materials of which mobile phones are made, we often hear silicon, plastic, aluminum, and iron — but not coltan. Despite the critical role that it plays in electronic devices, including our phones, it's a component that is almost unheard of among laymen. Without coltan, though, your phone won't work properly, or not at all. It will surprise you what wonders it can do for your mobile companion. But, you'll also be horrified by the sad truth about it."
