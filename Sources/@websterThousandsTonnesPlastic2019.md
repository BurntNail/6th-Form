abstract: "Millions of plastic pots, tubs and trays placed in recycling bins are secretly being incinerated because of a lack of specialist facilities to process them. The plastic is collected from homes but rather than being turned into new products it is sent to “energy from waste” plants that burn it to generate electricity."
