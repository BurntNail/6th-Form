title: "Winning Skin"
abstract: "Michael Phelps marched into the Beijing National Aquatics Center with his three teammates. The camera lingered on his anxious mother while the crowd hummed with anticipation. If the American team won this race, the 100-meter medley relay, Phelps would earn his eighth gold medal of the 2008 Olympics and eclipse Mark Spitz, who had won seven golds in 1972. Phelps would swim the butterfly stroke in the third leg. As he waited, he removed his cocoon of hooded robe and headphones, revealing a sleek black swimsuit that looked more like a pair of tights than a bathing suit."
