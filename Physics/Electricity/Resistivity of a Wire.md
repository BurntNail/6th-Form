# Method
We will place the nicrome wire within the jaws of a micrometre. We are using a digital  micrometre, so we must zero out the scale beforehand, and then read the reading  from the display. We got 0.41mm which is the diameter. Since the micrometre  measures up to 0.01mm, we can say that the result was 0.41 ± 0.01mm. However,  to get the cross-sectional area of the nicrome wire we need to get the radius,  so we divide by 2 to get 0.205 with a relative uncertainty of 4.9%. Then we can  use the equation for the area of a circle to get 0.13 mm^2 with 9.8%  uncertainty, or 0.13 mm^2 ± 0.01mm
