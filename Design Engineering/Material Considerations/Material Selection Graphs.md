# [YM - Density](http://www-materials.eng.cam.ac.uk/mpsite/interactive_charts/stiffness-density/NS6Chart.html)
## Many [[Aluminium]] alloys are heat treatable â€“ what does this mean and how is strength affected
  - This means that they can change strength and hardness using heat. This means that these materials can be in multiple places on the Material Selection Graph. **increase wear resistance, mention anneal**
## Select Materials for a Rucksack
  - Use Carbon Fibre, as it is both quite strong and not too dense (not dissimilar from water). It can also be interwoven into other materials.
  - You could also use Nylon, as it is less strong than Carbon Fibre, but much lighter.
  - **Also polyester, cheap, lightweight, floats**
## Select materials for a car wheel
  - You could use a material like Titanium as it is quite strong, as well as dense to make sure the car is firmly on the ground.
  - You could also use another metal like Stainless Steel, which is cheaper.

# [Strength - Density](http://www-materials.eng.cam.ac.uk/mpsite/interactive_charts/strength-density/NS6Chart.html)
## Which polymers float?
  - PMAA
  - uPVC
  - UF
  - Polystyrene
  - Polycarbonate
  - Nylon
  - **Mention < dense than water at:** $1000kg/m^3$
## Why do brass and copper have similar properties?
  - Both contain Copper, just Brass is an alloy.
## Why are designers trying to use composites in aircraft?
  - Because you can combine multiple materials with different properties to get the best properties of other materials. **Lighter, strength for less weight**
