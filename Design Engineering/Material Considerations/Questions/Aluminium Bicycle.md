> The frame of the folding bicycle is made from an aluminium alloy.
> Explain 2 properties of aluminium alloy which makes it a suitable material for the frame

1) Aluminium has a high strength to weight ratio, meaning that very little of it can be used with the bicycle whilst still remaining structurally stable. This is good for cyclists who want to reduce weight so that they can reach the same speeds with less effort.
2) Aluminium doesn't rust and is corrosion resistant, meaning that the end users don't need to worry about regularly washing the bicycle to avoid rust, making the use of the bicycle low-friction, encouraging the cyclist to use their bicycle more, which is positive for the environment

**or, can be welded: good for manufacture, available in tubes: can be cut from stock in manufacture, can take a paint finish: aesthetics**
