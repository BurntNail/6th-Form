> The body of the drone has been manufactured from [[Acrylonite-Butadine-Styrene]]. Explain **2** reasons why [[Acrylonite-Butadine-Styrene]] is a suitable material choice for the body of the drone
 - [[Acrylonite-Butadine-Styrene]] has high impact resistance, meaning that when the drone inevitably crashes, the damage will be lesser than if it had been made out of a different material. **less likely to crash with obstacles**
 - [[Acrylonite-Butadine-Styrene]] also has a relatively low melting point and is a [[Thermopolymers|Thermoplastic]], meaning that it can be recycled and injection-moulded, useful for high detail intricate drone designs. **at low cost and high volume**
 - **also: good electrical insulator, not affected by sun/rain, high quality finish, high strength-weight ratio**
