# Cultural Impacts
 - Smaller Phones as Tantalum capacitors are very capacitive.
 - Coltan also makes Audio filters.
 - Coltan is an ingredient in making LCD screens, which are very common.
 - Coltan also had a small time in the limelight, as it caused some phones to explode, like (possibly) the Note 7. Although this might have been another material that was exploding from over-charging and bad design.

 - The majority of the miners are ex farmers who had their livestock stolen throughout the ongoing civil war
 - All taxes and fees are paid by the miners and not by the companies running them. Causing the miners to fall into large amounts of debt
 - Miners who have significant debt cannot leave their mining village as if they leave they will be arrested as the police think they are trying to flee to avoid payments.
